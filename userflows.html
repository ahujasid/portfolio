    <div class = "content-flex eightyw mt56">
        <div class = "h3 content-header">Background</div>
        <div class = "content">userflows.design is an inspiration website that helps designers ideate quickly by gathering inspiration from features by leading design companies in a straightforward and contextual way.</div>

    <!-- =========================  RESEARCH  ============================ -->

    <div class = "h2 eightyw mt80">Research</div>
    
    <div class = "content-flex eightyw mt56">
        <div class = "h3 content-header">Assumption</div>
        <div class = "content">Well documented design flows in their context could serve as a reference and a point of inspiration for ideation. Having a look at multiple flows in one place would allow you to get inspired by the best bits and pieces from each flow. This was an assumption that I wanted to test with the research.</div>
    </div>

    <div class = "content-flex eightyw mt56">
            <div class = "h3 content-header">User Research</div>
            <div class = "content">Talking to designers in Bangalore, I realized a lot of beginner designers were facing the problem of finding good features and user journeys in one place. You have to create accounts and go through the flows each time, which is time taking. Apart from that, it is hard to tell which flows are helpful or not, unless you have completely gone through them. Because of this, getting the right inspiration became long and painstaking.

    <div class = "content-flex eightyw mt56">
            <div class = "h3 content-header">Competitor Analysis</div>
            <div class = "content">
                <div class = "quote">Designers’ search for inspiration is based on the feature they are currently designing. In contrast, most curation websites offer exploration based on products or companies first.</div>
                <div class ="mt40"></div>I went through a lot of competitor websites who curate feature flows, and asked about them in my interviews too. The most important insight for me was that although there exist a lot of websites which provide curated flows, none of them allow you to search by the feature you are designing, but instead by the company who has made it. This was not very practical. 
                <div class = "mt40">
                Let’s say the designer is creating an onboarding feature. They would want to search for “onboarding” and see all the products with good onboarding flows. In contrast, most curation websites offer exploration based on products. Users have to go through each product and painstakingly look for an onboarding flow from the many flows available.

            <div class = "h3 content-header">Paper Prototypes</div>
            <div class = "content">I started creating the wireframes and going through them quickly, based on the insights I received from the Research phase. The aim was to think of how the website could be made such that one could easily search by the feature category, and how everything could be made contextual and easy to understand.</div>

        <!-- =========================  WHAT NEXT?  ============================ -->

        <div class = "h2 eightyw mt80">What next?</div>

        <div class = "content-flex eightyw mt56">
           
                <div class = "h3 content-header">User Acquisition</div>
                <div class = "content">The website has over 2k+ unique visitors, and 600 of them in the last month itself. I plan to experiment with how to grow an audience, and retain them. The website is free for now and I do not plan on generating any revenue from it as of now, since it is more of an experimental side project.
                    <div class = "mt40"></div>
                    I am using Google Analytics to track acquisition and behaviour metrics.

        <div class = "content-flex eightyw mt56">
            <div class = "h3 content-header">Long term value</div>
                <div class = "content">My hypotheses is that letting users log in and save their favourite flows will help with user activation, and ultimately retention by providing them long term value. There is also immediate value if the user finds what they are looking for, and helps them get inspired for whatever they are building at the moment.
                    <div class = "mt40"></div>
                    Before all that happens though, I plan on adding more flows to the website.
