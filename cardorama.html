    <!-- =========================  OVERVIEW  ============================ -->

    <div class = "h2 eightyw mt56">Overview</div>
    
    <div class = "content-flex eightyw mt56">
        <div class = "h3 content-header">Background</div>
        <div class = "content">Cardorama is a result of a 3-week course on Sustainable Tangible Design taught at CIID. The project was made with two other teammates Shailee Advani, and Suniti Thapa.</div>
    </div>

    <div class = "content-flex eightyw mt56">
            <div class = "h3 content-header">Brief</div>
            <div class = "content">The brief was to create an electronic product with a positive glocal impact, resulting in a step forward for sustainability.</div>
    </div>

    <div class = "content-flex eightyw mt56">
            <div class = "h3 content-header">Role</div>
            <div class = "content">My individual role in the team was coding, video editing, and electronic circuitry. We also did prototyping, storytelling, filmmaking and brainstorming together as a group.</div>
    </div>

    <div class = "content-flex eightyw mt56">
            <div class = "h3 content-header">Outcome</div>
            <div class = "content">Cardorama is a toy service concept that aims to create toys that reduce waste produced by the toy industry by using materials that can be easily recycled and reusing components that are difficult to recycle.
                <div class = "mt40"></div>
                Cardorama makes interactive toys with an electronic core and a cardboard outer shell. The electronic core remains the same, and the outer cardboard shell can be easily replaced, recycled, or re-made to place over the core. The core recognises what is placed on top of it, and reprograms itself to behave that way.
                For example, if a car shaped cardboard was placed on top of the core, the toy would behave like a car. If turtle-shaped cardboard was placed instead, the toy would behave like a turtle.</div>

    <div class = "content-flex eightyw mt56">
        <div class = "h3 content-header">Overview</div>
        <div class = "content">The research took 3 days and was divided into desk research and user interviews. The desk research was to find out how the problem existed on a global context. The user interviews were to understand how the global problem manifested itself in local contexts. The summary of the research can be seen in the video below.

        <div class = "content">
            We conducted desk research for a more global overview of the problem space. <div class = "mt40"></div>
            <div class = "quote">On a global scale, 80% of the toys produced end up in landfills as they are too hard to take apart and recycle. We were also guided by UN's Sustainable Goal #12, specifically: Responsible Consumption.</div>
            <div class = "mt40"></div>
            We wanted to reduce E-waste stemming from the volume of toys that are produced on a global level.

            <div class = "h3 content-header">User Interviews</div>
            <div class = "content">We did some user interviews to see how this problem manifests on a more local level.<div class = "mt40"></div>
                    On a local level, kids receive a lot of toys from their parents and as gifts on special occasions. These toys are usually cheap, and get broken very easily. Either that, or children lose interest in toys fast due to their quick cognitive growth. This ends up in parents throwing the old toys away, contributing to landfill waste, and buying newer cheap toys, which break again or are forgotten, perpetuating a loop of buying cheap toys.

                    <div class = "mt40"></div>

                    Once the child loses interest in the toy, another cardboard toy can be made with any kind of cardboard by looking up cutting instructions online.
                    <div class = "mt40"></div>
                    The cardboard is detected by a color sensor on the electronics module, which reprograms itself to behave in a particular way. We imagine kids playing around with coloring the inside of the cardboard and placing it on the module to see how the behaviour changes.
                    <div class = "mt40"></div>
                    We also learned from our insights that co-creation is a good way to build connections with kids. We imagine the toy to be used by kids of all ages, starting out with co-creation, and building it themselves as they grow older.

                <div class = "h3 content-header">Prototyping</div>
                <div class = "content">The electronic core module contained an Arduino with two stacked shields for mp3 playback and DC motor control. There was a small speaker connected to an audio amplifier, a button for basic interactions, an LED strip, and a color sensor to detect colors from the cardboard pieces. There were also wheels for it to move.
                    <div class = "mt40"></div>    
                    My teammate also built two cardboard toys for a car and turtle. Switching these toys over the electronic module changed how the module behaved. The wheel speed changed, the LED color changed, and the sound changed. We also built in more interactions like honking the car horn from the top.

There is also immediate value if the user finds what they are looking for, and helps them get inspired for whatever they are building at the moment.
                    <div class = "mt40"></div>
                    Before all that happens though, I plan on adding more flows to the website.
